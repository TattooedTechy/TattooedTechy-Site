How to Update Your Website

Hello Vincent. This guide explains how to add new content to your website.

The entire site is dynamic. You only need to edit one file: content.json.

The Core Concept

You edit content.json: You add a new JSON "object" (a new post) to the top of this file.

The "Category" is Key: The "category" you assign to your new post tells the website where it should appear.

The Site Updates Automatically:

Hub Pages (like tattoos.html or index.html) will show the 6 newest posts for their category.

Archive Pages (like tattoos-all.html) will show all posts for that category, with the newest at the top.

The "Category" System: Where to Post Content

This is the most important part. Use the correct "category" to make your post appear on the right pages.



Category | Post to | Descrition

tattoo | tattoos.html, tattooes-all.html, index.html |	Pictures and progress updates of your tattoo work.

anime-review |	anime.html, anime-reviews.html, index.html |	Written reviews or longer-form thoughts on completed anime.

tech |	technology.html, technology-all.html, index.html |	Posts related to coding, Web3, and general technology projects/thoughts.

investment |	investments.html, investments-all.html, index.html |	Market commentary, crypto updates, or financial thoughts.

home |	home-improvement.html, home-improvement-all.html, index.html |	DIY projects and home improvement updates.

recipe |	food.html, food-recipes.html, index.html |	Cooking guides and recommended recipes.

review |	food.html, food-reviews.html, index.html |	Reviews of food products, restaurants, or specific dishes.



Note: index.html shows the 6 newest posts from ALL categories combined.

How to Add a New Post (Step-by-Step)

Open the content.json file.

Go to the very top of the file, right after the first [ bracket.

Paste your new content object.

CRITICAL: Add a comma (,) after the closing } brace of your new post. This separates it from the next post.

Example: Adding a New Post

Your content.json file before:


    {
        "id": "",
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "category": "",
        "title": "",
        "description": "",
        "imageUrl": "",
        "linkUrl": "",
        "aspect": ""
    },





Your content.json file after adding a new "Tattoo" post:

[
    {
        "id": "tattoo-29",
        "date": "2025-11-12",
        "category": "tattoo",
        "title": "New Hand Tattoo",
        "description": "Just got this new piece done on my left hand.",
        "imageUrl": "images/new-hand-tattoo.png",
        "linkUrl": "images/new-hand-tattoo.png",
        "aspect": "aspect-square"
    },
    {
        "id": "home-2",
        "date": "2025-11-11",
        "category": "home",
        "title": "Project: New Deck Stairs",
        "description": "Finished building the new stairs for the back deck. Much safer now!",
        "imageUrl": "[https://placehold.co/600x400/1f2937/d1d5db?text=Deck+Stairs](https://placehold.co/600x400/1f2937/d1d5db?text=Deck+Stairs)",
        "linkUrl": "#",
        "aspect": "aspect-video"
    },
    {
        "id": "tattoo-28",
...


Notice the new object was added at the top, and a comma was added after it.

Special Examples: YouTube and X Posts

Here are the specific examples you asked for. These will show up on your main index.html page.

Example: How to Add a YouTube Video

To add a YouTube video, you need the Video ID (the random letters in the URL).

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Video ID: dQw4w9WgXcQ

Use this ID to create the linkUrl and the imageUrl (for the thumbnail).

{
    "id": "youtube-2",
    "date": "2025-11-12",
    "category": "youtube",
    "title": "My Newest YouTube Video is Live!",
    "description": "Check out my latest video on my (placeholder) channel.",
    "imageUrl": "https:__//[img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg)",
    "linkUrl": "https:__//[www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)",
    "aspect": "aspect-video"
}


(Just replace dQw4w9WgXcQ with your real video's ID.)

Example: How to Add an X (Twitter) Post

Find the link to your post on X. For the image, it's best to use a placeholder, as X images are hard to link to directly.

{
    "id": "x-post-2",
    "date": "2025-11-12",
    "category": "x-post",
    "title": "My Latest Thoughts on X",
    "description": "Just posted a new thread about the current crypto market. Check it out!",
    "imageUrl": "[https://placehold.co/600x400/1f2937/d1d5db?text=X+Post](https://placehold.co/600x400/1f2937/d1d5db?text=X+Post)",
    "linkUrl": "https:__//[x.com/Tattooed_Techy/status/1234567890](https://x.com/Tattooed_Techy/status/1234567890)",
    "aspect": "aspect-video"
}
