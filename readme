# How to Update Your Website

Yes, the process is the same. You update the site by adding new content to the `content.json` file.

## Quick Guide

1.  **Open `content.json`**: This file contains all the content for your site.
2.  **Add a New JSON Object**: Copy the template below and paste it at the **very top** of the file, right after the opening `[`.
3.  **Add a Comma**: Add a comma after the closing brace `}` of your new object to separate it from the next one.
4.  **Fill in the Details**: Change the values for the `title`, `description`, `imageUrl`, etc.
5.  **Choose a Category**: The `category` field determines where your content will appear. See the table below for a list of available categories.

## JSON Template

Copy and paste this template into `content.json`:

```json
{
    "id": "unique-id-here",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "category": "category-name",
    "title": "Your Title Here",
    "description": "A short description of your content.",
    "imageUrl": "images/your-image.png",
    "linkUrl": "images/your-image.png",
    "aspect": "aspect-video"
},
```
